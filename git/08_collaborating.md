# Collaborating
How can we collaborate

- with others within one repository?
- with people who we might not know yet?

## Not a Big Issue?

- Organize TODOs, bugs, etc. of your project
- Issues can have ...
  - One or more assignees
  - Labels
  - Due dates
  - Links to other issues
  - ... and whole discussions below

## Collaborative Workflow

- Assign an issue to yourself
- Create a new branch
- Make reviewable changes
- Open a **pull request**
- Someone else reviews and approves the pull request
- Merge the pull request
- Use GitHubs **Insights ⇨ Network** to visualize the changes

## Exercise!

<ol style="font-size: smaller;">
  <li>Log into GitHub and create a new repository</li>
  <li>Make the repository public</li>
  <li><b>git clone</b> it to your desktop</li>
  <li>Add some code and push the changes to the repository</li>
  <li>Add one person as a collaborator (Settings -> Collaborators)</li>
  <li>Clone that repo</li>
  <li>Make changes on a new branch</li>
  <li>Push the changes</li>
  <li>Submit a Pull Request</li>
  <li>Wait for approval</li>
  <li>At the same time: review a collaborators Pull Request</li>
  <li>(Bonus) Learn about protecting branches and try it out.</li>
<ol>

## Distributed Workflow

<ol style="font-size: smaller;">
  <li>Remove your group member(s) as collaborators from your repository</li>
  <li>Fork another group members repo (Repository page, top right corner)</li>
  <li>Create an issue on the original repository</li>
  <li>Clone your forked repo to your computer</li>
  <li>Make some changes, use a somewhat real-world example so it makes sense to review it (but don't overdo it)</li>
  <li>Push it to your fork</li>
  <li>Make a pull request from your fork to the main repository mentioning the issue</li>
  <li>(Consider turning your Pull Request into a draft Pull Request)</li>
  <li>Let your code be reviewed by tagging the repo owner using (@Username)</li>
  <li>At the same time: review Pull Request using comments on individual lines. Try to act as if it was a real peer review as much as possible.</li>
  <li>Accept or reject the Pull Request</li>
  <li>(Optionally) learn about merge conflicts and try it out in your collaboration.</li>
</ol>

## Remotes: Key Points

- Git and GitHub are superpowerful, not just for version control, but as tools for collaborative development
- Do code reviews and be constructive in them!
- Use centralized flow for internal collaborations
- Use distributed flow for external collaborations
