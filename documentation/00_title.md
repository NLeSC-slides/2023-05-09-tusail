## Code documentation lesson

+ Why would you document software?
+ What makes good documentation?
+ How do I write good in-code documentation?
+ How do I write good README files?
+ Demo creating documentation with Sphinx and deploying to Github pages.
+ Deploy a project website or personal homepage to Github pages. (?)
+ **Independent of programming languages**

## Episode 1: Motivation and wishlist

+ Why documenting code?
+ What is our wishlist on a suitably good documentation?
+ Is project documentation important? Why? Take a few moments to think about it.

## Exercise: Think of good and bad examples

Write down your thoughts in the collaborative documents.
Respond with emojis :+1: :scream_cat: to your colleagues’ answers.

+ Think of projects of which you like the documentation. What do you like about them?
+ Think of projects for which you don’t like the documentation. What don’t you like about them? Are you missing anything?

> NB: You can choose a mature library with lots of users for this exercise, but try to also think of less mature projects you had to collaborate on, or papers you had to reproduce.

## What did we learn?

+ It is important to document code.
+ Depending on the purpose and state of the project documentation needs to meet different criteria. 
+ For most scientific projects, in-code documentation and a well thought out README file is enough.
+ Documentation should be tracked with corresponding code.

## Episode 2: in-code documentation

+ What can I do to make my code more easily understandable?
+ What information should go into comments?
+ What information should go into docstrings?
